## About Breach Protocol

Breach Protocol is a specific kind of Quickhack that uploads Daemons onto a network. When you have a Cyberdeck, you can perform Quickhacks. Quickhacks work so long as you have RAM to pull it off. The default Quickhack that every Cyberdeck has is Breach Protocol. Breach Protocol breaks through a network's security and uploads Daemons. Daemons are programs that affect everything on the network for a period of time. Which Daemons get uploaded is determined by which sequences you complete successfully. You might see network security referred to as Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics (ICE), such as with ICEPick Quickhack Daemon. Networks are more geographical than an actual network of interconnected devices. Networks are made up of all people and devices in a location. You'll use Breach Protocol to decode Encrypted Shards or access networks. 

You’ll see a list of Daemons available to upload during Breach Protocol. Each Daemon comes with a sequence of characters that you’ll need to slot into your buffer via the matrix — in order — to upload it and gain its effect.

When you start selecting characters from the matrix, you have to start in the first row. You can select any character across that top row. The next character you select has to be in the same column as the first character you selected. The third has to be in the same row as the second. The fourth has to be in the same column as the third. That sequence of alternating between row and column keeps repeating from there.

Since you’ll have more Buffer slots than characters in the various Daemons’ sequences, you might be able to complete multiple sequences in the same buffer.

The buffer is the maximum number of characters you can choose in the matrix. You don’t have to (and often won’t) choose that many, but the size of your buffer is the max. You’ll start with four buffer slots. To get more buffer slots, you’ll need to acquire a new Cyberdeck from a ripperdoc. Your buffer slots are directly correlated with the amount of RAM of your Cyberdeck.
